# Civics Test 2022 app

Simple app for running through the 2022 USCIS Civics Test. Features include:

- [ ] Quiz questions with written answer prompts rather than multiple choice (real interview isn't multiple choice, but all apps seem to be)
- [ ] Go through the entire pool of questions
- [ ] Only ask missed questions after the first iteration
- [ ] Option to reset pool of known questions

Stretch goals:

- [ ] Automatically pull the USCIS PDF on startup and import it
- [ ] Release a generic quizzing framework
